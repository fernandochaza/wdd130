                Hello, World!. This is Fernando from Argentina. 
                I'm happily married with Melisa. We've been together for 17 years
                and have two children. Lucas, who is 15, and Emma, who is 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Applied
                Technology at BYU-Pathway Worldwide and I'm
                enroled in the Web Fundamentals and Programming with functions
                courses. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a life-long learner, I love programming and my goal
                is to become a profesional developer. For that reason I'm dedicating
                my free time to studying and practicing my skills.
                What I love of being a programmer is that I can create new things,
                things that didn't existed before. I would love to work on projects 
                that satisfice needs and make life better for the users.
